# pandas.py
This Python script demonstrates essential Pandas operations, including Series creation, DataFrame creation, indexing, filtering, slicing, conditional selection, modifying values, and performing mathematical/statistical operations. It acts as a beginner-friendly guide for understanding how to work with Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
# 🐼 Pandas Fundamentals in Python

This project contains a complete beginner-friendly Python script that demonstrates how to work with **Pandas**, one of the most powerful data manipulation libraries in Python.  
The script covers Pandas Series, DataFrames, indexing, filtering, slicing, boolean operations, modification of data, and performing analytical operations.

## 📌 About the Project

The script includes:

### ✔ Pandas Series
- Creating empty and populated Series  
- Accessing values, indexes, slicing, and boolean filtering  
- Applying operations like mean, std, log, etc.  
- Modifying existing values in a Series  

### ✔ Pandas DataFrame
- Creating DataFrames from lists and dictionaries  
- Setting and resetting index  
- Accessing rows, columns, and multiple selections  
- Filtering rows based on conditions  
- Retrieving specific values using `.at` and `.loc`

This script serves as a solid foundation for anyone learning **data analysis with Python**.
